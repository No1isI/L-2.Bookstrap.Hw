   <h1>Soccer</h1>
   <p>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played between two teams of 11
players who almost exclusively use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch.

The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a
rectangular-framed goal defended by the opponent.</p>
<p>There are plenty of players in football like<mark>Goal keepers,Attackers/Front fielders,Mid fielders,Defenders,Substitutes etc. </mark></p>
<p><code>Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an
estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.

Association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since
1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in
circumference. The two teams compete to score goals by getting the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts,
under the bar, and fully across the goal line).</code></p>
